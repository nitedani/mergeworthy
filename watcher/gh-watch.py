"""Robust GitHub watch for the tracked threads. One line on stdout per event.

- The comments the agent answers (mergeworthy:github-threads), new or edited, each with an :eyes: reaction: a maintainer's
  (write access) on a thread in threads.txt, the threads the agent opened or posted in; and yours with /ai or /agent, on any thread
  (your events feed; one watch dir gets each, see main_dir). Nothing else.
- Your "/agent ..." comments on threads no watch dir lists, found in the watched repos' recent comments (search as a backup) and sent to one dir (see agent_command): `### AGENT COMMAND`.
- FOLLOW-UP: later commits by others to the lines of your merged PRs, and PRs that reference them (see follow_ups), for 60 days after the merge.
- Machine-wide work (those two) runs in one daemon at a time (shared_pass). Every call goes through request(), which keeps the
  hour's budget (see "The GitHub API budget") and sends ETags; a rate-limit pause prints one WATCH ERROR per daemon.
- Maintainers' commits pushed to a tracked PR, and 👍/👎 from GH_WATCH_EYES on the agent's comments.
- WAIT PING DUE: your account's comment is the last on an open thread and has had no reply for WAIT_PING_HOURS (3).
- PR head/state changes (pushes, merges, closes), CI turning red or green on open PRs, and your PR's code (tests excluded) changing by more than ~80 lines since its last refactor pass (REFACTOR STALE).
- How often each thread is read depends on its state (see "How often a thread is read"); the notifications, your events feed
  and the repos' issue lists are polled once per X-Poll-Interval, the repo lists by the one daemon holding the lease for all.
- Every request is counted, 304 answers too (tally; `gh-watch.py --stats` prints the rate, and once an hour a line goes to gh-watch-stats.log).
State lives in gh-watch-state.json: every seen (id, updated_at) pair, so nothing is skipped or repeated,
and scans overlap by 10 minutes. A failed API call prints WATCH ERROR and that thread's scan position isn't advanced.
